- **Windows Individual License:** The license files are stored here: `%AppData%\MathWorks\MATLAB\R20XXx_licenses` (NOTE: Replace "R20XXx" with release number, e.g. R2013a.) The %AppData% folder is hidden by default. To get there, open the Start Menu, enter %AppData% in the search box, and press enter. It can also be located at: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming`
- **Windows Designated Computer, Concurrent, and Network Named User licenses:** The license files are stored in the "licenses" folder within the MATLAB installation folder. If MATLAB is installed in the default location, license files are stored here: `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R20XXx\licenses` (NOTE: Replace "R20XXx" with release number, e.g. R2013a.)
- **MacOS Individual License:** The license files are stored in the Application Support directory. Click on the Finder icon in your dock (the blue face) and go to the "Go" menu in the menu bar. Select "Go to Folder " and enter this: `/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/MathWorks/MATLAB/` where $USER is the username you use to login to your computer. In the folder that opens up, your license files are stored in the "R20XXx\_licenses" folder, where R20XXx is the release of MATLAB you are using, e.g. R2013a. For R2016b and older, the license files are located in a different directory. Instead, navigate to: `~/.matlab` and then enter the appropriate R20XXx\_licenses folder.
- **MacOS Designated Computer, Concurrent, and Network Named User licenses:** The license files are stored inside the MATLAB application package. Right click, CTRL-click, or two-finger click on the MATLAB icon in your Applications folder and select "Show Package Contents." In the folder that opens up, open the "licenses" folder to see your license files[^1^].
- **Linux Individual License:** The license files are stored in the ".matlab" folder within your home folder: `~/.matlab`. In the .matlab folder, license files are stored in separate folders for each release: `R20XXx_licenses` (NOTE: Replace "R20XXx" with release number, e.g. R2013a.)
- **Linux Designated Computer, Concurrent, and Network Named User licenses:** The license files are stored in the MATLAB installation directory: `$MATLAB/licenses`. If MATLAB is installed in the default location, license files are stored here: `/usr/local/MATLAB/R20XXx/licenses` (NOTE: Replace "R20XXx" with release number, e.g. R2013a.)

## How to Use Your License File
